# UFOs

##Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is too create a webpage that allows users to search UFO sightings.  This webpage was created so that the sightings can be filtered with multiple critiria such as by date, city, state, country, and shape. By creating this webpage, users will have better acess to exploring and learning about UFO sightings.

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
##Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.


##Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
A drawback to this webpage, is that it is static. THis means the webpage will always look the dame when it is visted.  One way to make it more appealing is to make it a dynamic webpage.  This way it will be more interactive with the webpage and can change based on the user or time of day.  Another recommendation is to put in links for users to learn more about spacific UFO sightings.
