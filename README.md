## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
A drawback to this webpage, is that it is static. This means the webpage will always look the same when it is visted.  One way to make it more appealing is to make it a dynamic webpage.  This way it will be more interactive with the users and can change based on the user or time of day.  Another recommendation is to put in links for users to learn more about spacific UFO sightings.  This webpage is a really good start, but there is always improvements that can be made.
